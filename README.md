# Bike Sharing Demand Analysis - Assignment 2

## Overview
This project is part of an academic assignment analyzing the Bike Sharing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains hourly records of bike rentals in Washington, D.C., alongside weather conditions and other predictive factors. The goal is to perform EDA and build a regression model to predict bike demand.

## Dataset
- Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset)
- File used: `hour.csv` (hourly bike rental data)
- Features: Includes time, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rental counts.

## Key Tasks
- Data Preprocessing – Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identifying trends, correlations, and key features
- Feature Selection – Using a forward selection approach for model optimization
- Regression Modeling – Predicting bike rental demand using Linear Regression
- Model Evaluation – Assessing performance using R² score and error metrics
